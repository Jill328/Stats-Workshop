An Array- used to store multiples values in a single varaible, instead of declaraing seperate variables for each value (cuts down on writing code)
Brackets, [], are used to define the varaible type.
  String[] instruments;
  String [] instruments= {"trombone", "trumpet", "bass"};
  int[] myNum = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4,}
Index- used to refer to array element [0]=1st; [1]=2nd;
Array Length: how many elements an array has (instruments.length)
 
Loops-a code structure that allows you to do something very similiar repeatedly.

     a. for - loops through a block of code a number of times
     b. for/in - loops through the properties of an object
     c. for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
     d. while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
     e. do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
     f. break and continue: exits the loop entirely (bk); skips the current iteration and moves to the next (continues).
     


//*For Loops-
//*A for loop repeats  until a sprcified condion evaluates to false. actions that happens for as many times a loop runs until the condition is met
 // It includes
       for (initializer; condition; iterator/afterthought) {
       //Statement - What should happen FOR every loop
       // };
    //initializer= let statement (runs before the code block)
    // condition = < , > (true; false)(usually use less than)(evaluated before code block runs; if true, the loop runs, if false loop stops)
    // iterator/afterthought = how we are going to change our initializer); example: ++1; gets looked at after everytime our code block runs until the condition is met. In charge of changing the initializer).
    //Statement: what we want to happen everytime this code runs.

 //*While loops- used for while something is happpening
    // where the iterator is placed in the code makes a difference
